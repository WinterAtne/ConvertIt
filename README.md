### Usage
If you only want to use the application, run
```./gradlew run --args="$(arguments)"```
### Instalation
If you want a standalone build, run
```./gradlew installDist```
Which will create an install path under build/install, which can be moved anywhere you like. May require additional set up depeneding on desired instalation.
